# Element Maps

Element maps are the standard way we document which UI elements trigger which actions and backend behavior. They exist so that implementation (human or automated) can one-shot wiring without ambiguity.

## Purpose

- **Reproducibility**: Any reader (or LLM) can see exactly which button, in which component, does what and what the backend must do.
- **One-shot implementation**: Backend and front-end wiring can be implemented from the map without guessing.
- **Traceability**: Every meaningful user action (click, submit, etc.) is tied to a component, element (class or label), and backend requirement.

## Standard format

Each entry follows:

**Page or modal** → **Component (file)** → **Element (class or label)** → **Action** → **Backend**

Example:

- `Chat` → `Chat.tsx` → `Comp_Button-Primary_approve` (label "approve") → On click: persist approval, optionally show sign-in modal or go to editor → Backend: session/card state, auth check.

## When to create or update element maps

- **New screen or modal**: Before or as you implement, add an element map entry for every interactive element (buttons, links, form submits).
- **New flow or variant**: Update the master prompt’s element map section and any flow-specific tables.
- **Refactors**: If you rename a component or move it, update the element map so paths and names stay accurate.

## Where they live

- The **master prompt** (`docs/MASTER_PROMPT_BACKEND.md`) contains the full element map for the three flows (sender, receiver, returning user), plus modals and shared components.
- This cursor rule defines the format and process; it does not replace the master prompt’s map.

## CSS classes and labels

- Prefer the **exact class names** used in code (e.g. `Comp_Button-Primary_approve`, `Comp_NavMenu_Link`) when documenting.
- When a class is generic, use the **visible label** (e.g. label "approve", "send", "create account") so the element is uniquely identifiable.
- Follow the naming convention in `ui-styling.mdc` (`Comp_`, `Layout_`, `Chat_`) so element names stay consistent.
