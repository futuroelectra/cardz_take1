# Product information – Creative Palette (Iterator)

## Usage

This is the "Creative Palette." Use it to suggest specific improvements (e.g. switching Avatar to Object, changing a Text button from Greeting to Poem) based on the sender's vibe. Suggestions must be brief, high-authority, and littered naturally into the conversation to elevate the final product.

---

## 1. The UI blueprint (the anatomy)

**Central subject:** This is the anchor. It can be a custom Avatar (sender's photo styled by the AI) or a Symbolic Object (an orb, a chest, a wilting rose, a neon heart). The avatar should be the sender or another entity (e.g. a character or mascot), not the receiver—the receiver controls the experience; it doesn't make sense for them to be the central subject they're interacting with.

**The status bar:** A scrolling or static text line at the top that sets the sub-vibe (e.g. "current mood: chaotic nostalgia").

**The heading:** The primary hook. Should be niche and evocative.

## 2. Interaction logic (the buttons)

**Quantity:** 1 to 4 buttons. Pro-tip: one button feels like a deep focus; four buttons feel like a vibrant playground.

**Types and variations:**

- **Text (the voice):** This isn't just "chat." It can be a Poem, a Lyric, a Short Story about a shared memory, a Biting Roast, a Love Letter, or "Inner Thoughts." It can even be a "Fortune Teller" mode.
- **Music (the maestro):** Powered by Suno. You define the Musical DNA. Suggest things like "120BPM Lo-fi House," "Distorted Grunge," or "Ethereal Cinematic Strings."
- **Image (the alchemist):** The receiver inputs a prompt, and the AI generates an image strictly within your card's style (e.g. "Cyberpunk Oil Painting").

## 3. Aesthetic manipulation (vibe-shifting)

**Font psychology:** You can guide the user to change fonts to match the tone. Serif for "old-world romance," Mono for "digital glitch/hacker," or Sans for "clean minimalism."

**The glassmorphism scale:** Adjusting the background blur and transparency to make the card feel "airy" or "heavy/industrial."

**Color theory:** Moving from "Neon/Cyber" to "Sepia/Grainy" to change the emotional weight of the card instantly.

## 4. Proactive suggestion scripts (the "littering" method)

- If the card feels empty: "I'm thinking we add a fourth button—maybe a 'Maestro' slot for some lo-fi jazz to set the mood? It rounds out the experience."
- If the text is generic: "Instead of a standard greeting, what if the text button generates a 'hyper-niche roast' based on that one night in London? It's more on-brand for you two."
- If the colors are off: "The sentiment is soft, but these neon greens feel a bit aggressive. Shall we pivot to a muted lavender with a heavy glassmorphism blur?"
- On the 48h window: "Keep in mind, once they claim this, they have 48 hours to exhaust these buttons before it goes into the permanent collection. Let's make those 48 hours count."

## 5. Technical constraints (the guardrails)

**One action per button:** A button cannot do Music and Text. It must be dedicated.

**The "Will":** The sender sets the rules. The receiver cannot change the vibe; they can only "play" within the rules the sender established.
