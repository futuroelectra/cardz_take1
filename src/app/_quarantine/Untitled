I want to make an adjustment to the logic of the site. Currently when you click 'Approve' it goes straight through to the loading screen. I would like to make some changes to that. When you click 'Approve' I would like there to be a pop-up modal. It can be styled after 'Rule Activate Modal.tsx'. However I'd like this modal to be the 'Sign up' or 'Sign in' modal. You may take some creative freedom to complete this modal based on the design principles already laid out. So it looks like it belongs with just a simple email, password and confirm password for 'Sign up'. And sign in just email and password with the relevant things there. Including the terms and conditions privacy section underneath. Then let's begin with just this.
